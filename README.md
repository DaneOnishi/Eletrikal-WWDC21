# Eletrikal-WWDC21
My submission for Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Swift Student Challenge

ringing knowledge about energy efficiency to elementary school children in the context of social isolation was what moved me to develop this playground.

For this, I took into account some educational factors to improve the experience of child users. Present the theme in a fun, interactive and linear way and, at the same time, hold your attention during the three minutes without causing cognitive overload, facilitating the understanding about the theme.

The project was created in PlaygroundBook, using the Swift Playgrounds Author Template in Xcode. The split view format resembles an interactive children's book, which was super positive considering the project proposal.

I started the scope in the Miro tool to group all the ideas for each page and ask for feedback from colleagues and mentors. Then the design part was in charge of adobe illustrator. I chose to illustrate using simple shapes and some isometric angles that allow to represent large-scale environments and objects, such as the wind turbine and the room, using little space on the screen.
I was concerned with maintaining a style similar to current cartoons to familiarize children with the book.

The eletrikal was developed with the SpriteKit library, which made it possible, in a simplified way, to add design elements that are visually interesting for the user and, in addition, allowed the creation of organic frame transitions, which give the sensation of movement. The use of SKLightNode was essential for this project, being possible to reliably simulate different types of lighting.

Sound effects were added through AVAudioPlayer, making it possible to apply auditory feedback to some actions, making the playground more immersive. The button sounds were taken from xx and the background sounds from xx

Finally, adding assessment statuses by importing Playground Support was the icing on the cake, making the page transition much more organic.
